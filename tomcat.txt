Apache Tomcat has several important folders in its directory structure. Here’s a breakdown of the main ones:

* bin/ – Contains startup (startup.sh, startup.bat) and shutdown (shutdown.sh, shutdown.bat) scripts, along with other executables.

* conf/ – Contains configuration files like:

* server.xml (Main configuration file)

* web.xml (Default web application settings)

* tomcat-users.xml (User roles and authentication)

* lib/ – Stores shared libraries (.jar files) required by Tomcat.

* logs/ – Stores logs like catalina.out, which logs Tomcat’s runtime activities.

* temp/ – Holds temporary files used by Tomcat during execution.

* webapps/ – The deployment directory where web applications (.war files) are placed.

* work/ – Stores compiled JSP files and intermediate data.

* ROOT/ (Inside webapps/) – The default web application if no specific path is given.

1) Apache TomCat Folder Structure

   conf-configuration
   bin-binary (to start and stop the server)
   webapps-hosting the application
   logs-server logs
   lib-libraries
   temp-temporary files


2) How to access the application url:
   127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080
   <url of TomCat>/<ArtifactName>

   Ex:localhost:8080/aja 
   where "aja"-->Artifact Name

3) To create project in maven:
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.helloworld -DartifactId=helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp 
    -DinteractiveMode=false

4) How we can place the artifact from the maven project of target folder to apache tomcat webapp folder:
  cp <pathwhereartifact> <path where webapps of tomcat>
  cp <source> <destination>
  <destinationfolder> cp/<source> .

   while copying use forward slash "/"

4) If we do any configuration changes we need to restart the server
   To change the port number of tomcat server we need to stop and start server
   To stop tomcat ctrl+c

5) To deploy the application anotherway is by using the tomcat gui
   Access the url of tomcat then search for the .war file to deploy
   click on choose file it will open dialogbox in dialogbox we need to select the artifact and click on open then we need to click on deploy button

6) how can we access apache tomcat GUI go to tomcat home folder
   home folder of apache tomcat -->conf
   modify "tomcat-user.xml"(using text editor eg:vi)
   vi tomcat-user.xml (we need to search for the line)<user username="admin"
   need to uncomment these lines -- "<!--" "-->"
   once we modify tomcat-user.xml file save and quit

7) what is the difference between pom.xml and settings.xml
   Use pom.xml to define dependencies, plugins, and configurations specific to a project.
   Use settings.xml to configure Maven behavior globally, such as repository authentication and proxy settings.
