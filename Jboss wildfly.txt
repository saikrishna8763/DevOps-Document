DAY-8        DATE:1-2-2025
1) what is Jboss?
   Jboss is a powerful open source java application server developed by Redhat.

   website name:wildfly.org/downloads/
   current version is 35

   admin port no:9990

   application port no or artifacts:8080

   Admin: <URL:9990>
   Application:<URL:8080>/<application-name>

2) Folder structure of the Jboss wildfly

   domain
   modules
   welcome-content
   docs
   bin
   appclient

 one of the folder in folder structure standalone where we will be having the configuration and deployment folder and logs.

 configuration:where we will be having configurations of applications, users specifics.

 ex:mgmt-users.properties and mgmt-groups.properties

 Logs:standalone -->log -->logs of the wildfly

3) To start the Jboss go to the home folder of the wildfly then bin folder

   Home folder of wildfly-->bin
   Filename:standalone(windows batch file)

4) How to shutdown Jboss wildfly in windows(task)?
   bin-->jboss-cli.bat(click on this file and type command shutdown)

5) How to create management console user?
   management console user:
   <Home folder of wildfly>-->bin
   filename:add-user(windows batch file)

 once you run that add-user file we will get this console
 what type of user do you wish to add?
a) management user(mgt-user.properties)
b) application user(application-user.properties)

a) a

 It will going to ask me the username after username it will ask you for the password after setting password it will ask you to reenter the password

 Admin/management console:<URL:9990>

 username & password

     Deployments:

* A deployment represents anything that can be deployed(ex: an application such as EJB-JAR,WAR,EAR any kind of standard archive such as RAR or JBOSS-specific deployments)in to a server
  you can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments simply drag one or several files on to the deployment column.
  If there is already a deployment with the same name the deployment will be replaced otherwise the deployment will be added.The deployments added by drag and drop will be enabled by default.
  Left side when you click on plus symbol you will see options like upload deployment, unmanaged deployment,create empty deployment
  clicking on upload deployment

6) How to deploy the application or artifacts to the wildfly?
a. copying the war file and pasting it deployment folder of wildfly(Home of wildfly -->standalone -->deployments)
b. cp <artifact sourcepath> <destination of deployments of wildfly>
c. Jboss wildfly GUI-->upload Artifact

7) How we can change default port numbers of wildfly (9990 and 8080)task.
   standalone-->configurations-->standalone.xml and standalone-full.xml(change port numbers here)

8) How we can configure master/slave architecture in wildfly
 Domain Mode:         WildFly must be run in domain mode to enable master/slave functionality. 
 Domain Controller:   The master server acts as the domain controller, responsible for distributing configuration and
                      deployments to the slave servers. 

Configuration File:   The domain.xml file defines the domain configuration, including the master and slave servers, and 
                      their communication details. 



DAY: 9            DATE:4-2-2025



        CONFIGUREACTION CHANGES:~


* things to keep in mind before changing configuration changes:

 1> where to chnage

 2> backup

 3> how to chnage 

 4> try or experiment on local environments

 5>documentation


   SNAPSHOT/BACKUP:~

  for wildfly - configuration snapshot
            ^
            ^
=> home folder of wild fly-->standalone-->configuration-->standalone-xml-history

   file name: standalone.v1

   EX: port number change.v2

   need to re name the orginal or existing file and then replace the cutnomized as per requirement /changes


      different status of the artifacts deployed inwildfly:~

  In wildfly deployed artifacts can have various status in cluding

** DEPLOYED : the application is successfully running on the wildfly server and accessible to users

** UNDEPLOYED : THE application has been removed from the server and not currently running

** FAILED     : THE deployment process encountered an error and the appliction is not running

** DISABLE    : THE application is instentionally stoped by the administrator and cannot be accessed untestenabled

** SUSPENDED  : the application is temporarily paused and can be resumed later

** REDEPLOYNG : THE application is currentlybeing update with new code  and  is not fully available while the 
                redeployment process is ongoing


          ACCESSING DEPLOYING STATUS:~

 
          WILDFLY MANAGEMENT CONSOLE:

 you can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console which provides alist of deployments
 with with their current state.


      CLI:~ COMMAND LINE INTERFACE:~

  using the wildfly command line interface you can quary the ststus of deployments with managment commands


* indeicating whether the applivation is currently running not deployedencountered an error during deployment
  intentionally deactivated temporrarily paused or is in the process of being re-deployed with updates.


      DOMAIN & HOST CONTROLLER IN WILDFLY:~

 In jboss wildfly a domain contoroller is the central management point for a group of server within a domain 
 responisible for maintainty the overall configuration and policy

     while a host controller is a sperrate process running an each server within the domain communicating 
 with the domain conroller to manage the individual server instances on that host machine.

 essentiallythe domain controller dictates the overall configuration and the host controllers execute those 
 configuration  on their respective servers.


    KEY POINTS ABOUT DOMAIN AND HOST CONTROLLERS:~ 

    DOMAIN CONTROLLER:~

 1> act as the central management point for the entir domain 

 2> store the domain -wide configuration in a file called domain.xml
 
   (home folder-->domain-->configuration-->domain.xml)

 3> responisible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers with the domain.

    HOST CONTROLLER:~

 1> manages the application server instance running on a specific host.

 2> reeds its configuration from a host.xml file specific to that host
    (home folder-->domain-->configuration-->host.xml)

 3> communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances.



*** domain is reffearing to centrilized master wildfly where we can manage other -host wildfly server.
