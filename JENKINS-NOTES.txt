                *continuous integration*


IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:-
  1) Improve quality:- 
          Improves the quality by running multiply unit test and analysing various static codes.

  2) Increases productivity:-
          Automating build of code saves a lot of time, there by increasing productivity.

  3) Reduces risk:-
          Eliminating the risk of potential human errors by automating test.



INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS:-

   -> Easy installation process 
   -> provides advance security 
   -> optimized performance
   -> upgrades are easy available
   -> light weight container support
   -> distributed team management


WHAT IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:-
     It is the process of automating the building and testing of code, each time one of the team member commit changes to version control.
continuous integration, continuous delivery (or) deployment but delivery is also known as release, then first stage is CI, second stage is CD, 
and third stage is placing the artifact in the web server.

POPULAR CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION TOOLS:-

    -> Gitlab CI
    -> Code ship
    -> Bamboo
    -> Jenkins
    -> Team city
    -> Travis CI

   From the AWS cloud if we want to perform CICD, there are various services like code commit, code deploy and code guru, AWS code build, AWS pipeline.


IN AZURE CLOUD :-
    Azure devops, Azure boards, Azure repos, Azure pipeline, Azure test plans, Azure Artifact.


WHAT IS JENKINS?
       A continuous integration server which manages and control processes such as plain, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor in devops environment.


WHY JENKINS IS SO POPULAR?

PLUGIN MANAGEMENT IN JENKINS :~
 
 
              UPDATE -->shows update to already installed
 
              AVAILABLE -->show plugins that are available for installation
=>TABS
              INSTALLED -->display plugins installed that have no updates
 
              ADVANCED -->lists configuration of http proxy allows manual upload of plugin and url plugin site
 
 
In real time we cant install the plugins as simple as simple as that reasons being they meights be challanges
  with proxy settings as well as vpn (virtual private networking) in order to avoide we should configure HHTP 
  proxy in jenkins plugin of advance tab.

DAY-11           DATE:6-2-2025


             PLUGIN INSTALLATION:~

 THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO UNSTALL THE PLUGINS

 1> Automatically

 2> manually

 1>AUTOMAICALLY :> once we login to jenkins GUI left side you will be seen the option of manage jenkins click on manage
                   jenkins  we have system configuration

 ==>> click on plugins go to available plugins

 ==>> search for the plugin which is required 

 ==>> select the plugin under the list one you select the plugin install button  will be highlighted them click on install button

 2>MANUALLY :> under plugins tab go to available plugin and search for ansible plugin and click on the plugin which is required
               once you click on the plugin new	 tab will be open the click on the release, under release we will see the various
               version of the specific go for the plugin which is required the specific version under the installation option we 
               can see the direct link option we have to click on the direct link plugin will get downloaded to under local machine



Plugins definition:-
 
           Where we can add, remove, disable or Enable plugins that can Extend the functionality of Jenkins.
 
           → When we install the plugin in automatic way plugins Extention is JPI (Jenkins plugin) when Extention.
 
           we install the plugin in manually way plugin Extention is HPI (hudson plugin)
 
How to uninstall the plugins:-
 
          Manage Jenkins → plugins → Install plugins
 
          → Search Plugin name which we wanted to uninstall select the plugin and then uninstall button will be high lighted once clicked on uninstall,
              plugin will get uninstall.
 
How to update the plugins
 
           Manage Jenkins → plugins → updates
 
           → Select the plugin and then update button will be highlighted once clicked on update, plugin will get update.
 
Here's how to get this into a Word document:
          * Copy the text above.
 
          * Open a new Microsoft Word document.
 
          * Paste the copied text into the document. (You can use Ctrl+V or right-click and select "Paste")
 
          * Format the text as needed within Word. You can adjust font, spacing, add bullet points, etc.
 
          * Save the document. Choose a location and file name, and save it as a .doc or .docx file.
 
   → Select the plugin and then update button will be highlighted once clicked on update, plugin will get update.
   → In Real time we should not update the plugins directly, Reason being there may be the challenges Encountered. 
      It will be recommended to plugins in our local machines where other team members will not effected. If any thing goes wrong.
 
How to create the users?
 
     Manage Jenkins → Security → Users (Create/Delete/modify users that can log in to this Jenkins.)
 
   → Click on the users we can see the create user option after clicking on the user option we can see the username, password, confirm password,
       full name, Email address then click on create user.
 
How to give permission to users:-
 
    Manage Jenkins → Security (Secure Jenkins; define who is allowed access/use the system)
 
    → Best click on that there we can see Authorization under that you will see add user button, after click on that button we will get user id after giving
      user id then click on "Ok" button, after that we have to see user is added then we have to give required permission to the user by checking the box 
       (The minimum access is to give over all read)
 
    → By Default what ever we create users for Jenkins will get stored in Jenkins' own users data base.
 
    → This is suitable for smaller setup where you have no Existing user data base elsewhere. Other option is LDAP (Lightweight directory Access protocol)
 
Authorization Strategy:-
 
       By default we will see project based authorization matrix with these we can manage the authorization based on the options available under strategy.
 
             Example: Credentials, Agent, Job, Run, Etc...
Matrix authorization strategy:-
 
          Matrix Authorization allows configuring the lowest level Permissions, such as starting new builds, configuring items, or deleting them individually.
has context menu



 JENKINS PROJECT (PROJECT (OR) JOB BOTH ARE SAME)

  IT IS A COMBINATION OF ONE OR MORE TASKS

 ==>FREE STYLE PROJECT:~

    classic ,general-purpose job type that checkes out from one scm,executes build steps serially followed by post -build steps like archiving 
    artifacts and sening email notifications.

 ==>MAVEN PROJECT:~

    Build a maven project, jenkins takes advantages of your pom file and drastically reduces the configuration 

 ==>PIPELINE:~ 

    Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. Suitable for building
    pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily
    fit in free-style job type.

 ==>MULTI-CONFIGURATION PROJECT:~

    Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on
    multiple environments, platform-specific builds, etc.

 ==>FOLDER:~

    Creates a container that stores nested items in it. Useful for grouping things together. Unlike
    view, which is just a filter, a folder creates a separate namespace, so you can have multiple things


 ==>MULTI BRANCH PIPELINE:~

    Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.


 ==>ORGANIZATION FOLDER:~

    Creates a set of multibranch project subfolders by scanning for repositories.



        HOW TO CREATE THE JOB OR PROJECT :~

  In jenkins GUI will see the "+ new items" click on that new item the item name then select the item type once select any of the item
  click on "ok" button which is highlighted
 
 ==>> job configuration is conists of general (where we cangive information or discription about the project)

 ==>> source code management where we will be passing url of the repositories

 ==>> build triggers (in what way we wanted to trigger or build the job)

 ==>> build environment

 ==>> build steps (where we can add tasks)

 ==>> post-build actions


      HOW TO GET A FREE STYLE LEARNING JOB:~

 ==>> NEW ITEM (GIVE THE JOB NAME)

 ==>> select an item then click on "ok"

 ==>> go to the build steps configuration of jbos click on build steps dropdown and select execute windows batch command

 ==>> and just type "dir" and click on save 

 ==>> and click on build now option in the leftside and we can check there console output



                        BLUE OCEAN:~

   WHAT IS BLUE OCEAN ?

 * blue ocean rethinks the jenkins user experiences designed from the ground up for jenkins pipeline and comatible with freestyle jobs 

      
========================================================


 DAY-12                         DATE:7-2-2025



1) what if Jenkins user forget the password? 
   As a jenkin administrator there is a provision to reset the users credentials

   manage jenkins-->security-->users

   go for the user which need to be reset click on security(left side option)

   there you will see the password and confirm password and there you can change the password and click on save.

  once as a administrator change the password again you need to inform to the user please follow below steps to change the password.

  once logged in to user Jenkins gui click on username(top right corner) click on security there you can change the password click on submit

2) what if Jenkins administrator forget the password?(task)

   If a Jenkins administrator forgets the password, they can reset it using one of the following methods:

   Method 1: Reset via CLI (If Available)

   Method 2: Delete the Admin Password from config.xml

   Method 3: Reset Admin Password via User XML File

   Method 4: Check Initial Admin Password (For Fresh Installations)

      slaves, Nodes, agents(same in Jenkins)

3)  Jenkins Folder structure:

  In windows os we can see all Jenkins information and configuration details under the path
  c:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins

  under .Jenkins folder we can see the users folder(where all the Jenkins users data available)

  users folder(where all the Jenkins users data available)

  workspace(where all the configured jobs information available)

  secrets(where all the configured secrets are available)

  plugins(all the plugins)(which are installed manually and automatically) available

  nodes(where all the configured nodes are available)
 logs(we can see slaves)(if configured and tasks logs are available.

  apart from the above folders there is Jenkins configurational file namely config.xml
  (if at all changing the config.xml) first take the backup of file or copy the xml in some where else.

  we can also see the Jenkins log in Jenkins gui 

* path: manage jenkins-->status information--> system log --> then all Jenkins log once click on that you will see the log details

        we can see the Jenkins version bottom right corner in Jenkins gui and also

* path: manage jenkins-->status information--> about Jenkins

        website:crontab.guru
        (https://crontab.guru/)

     look for webhooks in git (task2)

* what: A Git webhook is a way for a repository to send real-time notifications to external services when certain events occur, such as a push, pull request, or merge. Webhooks are commonly used for CI/CD automation, triggering deployments, notifications, and integrations with other tools.

=> why:Why Use Git Hooks?
   Enforce coding standards (e.g., run linters before committing)
   Automate tasks (e.g., generate documentation on commits)
   Improve security (e.g., prevent committing secrets)
   Streamline workflows (e.g., trigger CI/CD processes locally) 

* purpose: Git hooks serve different purposes depending on when they are executed. There are two types:

1. Client-Side Hooks (Run on Developer's Machine)
   Used for automation before sending changes to a remote repository.

 pre-commit → Runs before a commit is created (e.g., check code style).
 commit-msg → Runs after commit message is written (e.g., enforce commit message format).
 pre-push → Runs before pushing changes (e.g., run tests).
 post-commit → Runs after a commit (e.g., send notifications).

2. Server-Side Hooks (Run on Remote Repository)
   Used to enforce policies and automate server-side processes.

  pre-receive → Runs before accepting a push (e.g., check branch policies).
  update → Runs when a branch is updated (e.g., enforce rules).
  post-receive → Runs after a push is completed (e.g., trigger deployments).

4) ways to trigger the Jenkins jobs

setup automated action that start your build based on specific events,like code changes or scheduled times.

a) Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)
   in order to use this option  or use this trigger first we need to generate the authentication token of the job

   Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts).You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely trigger this project's builds.This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous users.When that's not the case, Jenkins will reject requests sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token is specified.
  Use the following URL to trigger build remotely: JENKINS_URL/job/rasjsw/build?token=TOKEN_NAME or /buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN_NAME

b) Build after other projects are built:

   Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete, for example. we need to pass the job name (which are configured already) under projects to watch tab

  under projects to watch 4 options available 
  Trigger only if build is stable
  Trigger even if the build is unstable
  Trigger even if the build fails
  Always trigger, even if the build is aborted

c) Build periodically:

  This field follows the syntax of cron (with minor differences). Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace:
  MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW

  MINUTE   Minutes within the hour (0–59)
  HOUR	   The hour of the day (0–23)
  DOM	   The day of the month (1–31)
  MONTH	   The month (1–12)
  DOW	   The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.

  To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are available. In the order of precedence.

  for reference or practice go with the website crontab.guru

d) GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
   When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, GitHub Plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a GitHub repository which matches the Git repository defined in SCM/Git section of this job.

e) poll scm
   Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM.

  Trigger (way of running in the job)

  apart from the above 5types (triggers) we can also trigger jobs manually.

  Trigger-->way of running the job
