why DevOps?

traditional water fall model

The waterfall model is a project management methodology that breaks down a project into a series of sequential phases.
It's named after the way water cascades downward,

what are the steps involved in waterfall model

* Requrement and gathring analysis
* Design
* Implement
* Test
* Deploy
* MAINTENANCE

How it works?
* The model is linear, with each phase completed before moving on to the next 
* The model is rigid, with no flexibility to go back and change previous steps 
* The model is well-suited for projects with fixed budgets, timelines, and requirements  

What it's used for
* The waterfall model is used in software development and product development 
* It's also used in certain areas of engineering design 


What are its benefits? 
* The model can help minimize risk by integrating comprehensive documentation and upfront planning
* The model can help align with traditional project management approaches


What are its drawbacks?
* The model can be less flexible than other methods, like Agile 
* The model can lead to delayed testing, which can result in late discovery of mistakes and flaws 
* The model can lead to lower customer satisfaction due to a lack of customer feedback 


AGIL METHODOLOGY

Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks down projects into phases,  
or sprints, and encourages teams to reflect and improve after each sprint
It's an iterative approach that's designed to help teams develop products in environments that are subject to change.

1. FIRST ITERATION
* In this agile methodology each project is broken up into several iterations.

2. SECOUND ITERATION
* All iteration should be of the same time duration between 2 to 8 weeks.

3. THIRD ITERATION
* At the and of each iteration a working product should be delivered.


DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT DEVOPS CULTURE.

* Relese and Deploy
* Unpredictable issues
* Blame game
* Lack of monitoring 


DEVELOPMENT WITH DEVOPS CULTURE.

* Streamlined Deliveries
* Continuous monitrrings and feedback
* Team work in collaboration

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

* Use system with little (or) no waiting time
* Use system with update code 


OPERATIONS 

* System should be up and running most of the time
* System required for easy administration
* Effective monitoring and feedbacks system should be established


WHAT EXACTLY IS DEVOPS IN REAL LIFE 

DEVELOPMENT TEM:
* CODE
* PLANE
* TEST
* BUILD

OPERATION TEM
* RELESE 
* DEPLOY
* OPERATE
* MONITOR


WHAT DEVOPS IS NOT

* Devops is not a role person (or) organization
* Devops is not a separate team
* Devops is not a product (or) a tool
* Devops is not about just writing scripts (or) implementing tools

what is DevOps?

DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, 
that is development, testing, deployment and monitoring


What does DevOps do?

Integrates developers and operations teams improves collaboration and productivity by:
Automating infrastructure
Automating workflows
Continuously measuring application performance
